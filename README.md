For now, it will show tasks for a single project.
Later it might be extended to show multiple projects.

I am creating it to help with getting a shopping list... and be able to go
to the grocery without the phone... so without Internet.

Before leaving to the store you will need to manually sync it.
After returning from shopping you will also manually sync it.

It should be enough to just start the app on the watch, and the sync will
start.

I don't think that the app can run on the device in the background so there
is no way to auto-sync it.

Checked items are placed at the bottom to allow for easy undo.
